This folder provides an implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent, with Momentum and Nesterov Acceleration, in [TensorFlow 2.x](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). It bases on the article [On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/sutskever13.pdf) and adds Momentum Scheduler, extending native SGD implementation of TensorFlow.
