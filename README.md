This repository aims to provide implementations of modern optimization algorithms for machine learning in [TensorFlow 2.x](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), with the goal to reproduce experiments from the published research articles.


## Resume
* *sgd* : [On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/sutskever13.pdf) Ilya Sutskever, James Martens, George Dahl and Geoffrey Hinton, ICML 2013. Particularly, it adds momentum schedule and thus extends native SGD implementation of TensorFlow.
